<h1>Trigonometric Functions and its Testing by Team 6.</h1>

Trigonometric Functions such as sin, cos and tan are implemented by using taylor
serise and tested using JUnit in this project.

<h2>Functions Included</h2>

1. sin function
2. cos function
3. tan function

<h2>Test Cases</h2>

1. Calculating accurate value in radian
2. Checking other functionalities such as Power and Factorial
3. Calculating accurate value in degree
4. Normalizing radian value between 0 to 2 pi

<h2>Description of Test Cases</h2>

<h3>Test Case 1:</h3>

1. Checking accuracy of Trigonometric Functions

- First test case is to check whether the value which is generated by sin, cos and tan is accurate or not.

<h3>Test Case 2:</h3>

2. Checking other functionalities

- Second Test case is used for checking other supporting functionalities such as Power and Factorial which are cruial to count term in taylor serise.

<h3>Test Case 3:</h3>

3. Checking accuracy of Trigonometric Fucntions in Degree

- Third Test case is used for whether the functions are converting degree inputs to trigonometric values. For, that We converted degree to radian value.

<h3>Test Case 4:</h3>

4. Normalizing radian value between 0 to 2 pi

- Forth Test case is used for normalizing any value to 0 to 2 pi. ex. 60 radian.
